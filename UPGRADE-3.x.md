## Deprecated AbstractAdmin method argument

The `$context` argument is deprecated and will be removed.
Instead of relying on it (and using a `switch` statement),
rely on an abstraction, and inject different implementations of this abstraction in different actions.
Here is [an example](https://github.com/sonata-project/SonataAdminBundle/pull/3247#issuecomment-217744025).

This method will be final in 4.0.

## Backward compatibility break for AbstractAdmin::getSubject()

Now `AbstractAdmin::getSubject()` return `null` or `object` of subject entity. Previously,
`AbstractAdmin::getSubject()` may return `false` if entity identifier not match regexp `/^[0-9A-Fa-f\-]+$/`.

UPGRADE FROM 3.0 to 3.1
=======================

## Deprecated Admin class

The `Admin` class is deprecated. Use `AbstractAdmin` instead.

## Deprecated AdminExtension class

The `AdminExtension` class is deprecated. Use `AbstractAdminExtension` instead.

## Deprecated template fallback mechanism

## Deprecated AbstractAdmin methods
- `buildBreacrumbs` is deprecated, and no replacement is given, it will become an internal method.
- `getBreadcrumbs` is deprecated in favor of the homonym method of the `sonata.admin.breadcrumbs_builder` service.
- The breadcrumbs builder accessors are deprecated,
the `sonata.admin.breadcrumbs_builder` service should be used directly instead.
